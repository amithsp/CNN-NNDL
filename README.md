# CNN-NNDL

This is the project for analysing Real and AI Generated Art using CNN Model 

Dataset used for this model is [https://drive.google.com/file/d/19j4F0f6zEUb_FQuU9kBDLJh9trn4k49P/view?usp=sharing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashbowman/ai-generated-images-vs-real-images?resource=download-directory&select=RealArt)

This Dataset has few Problems as so if the ai art is classified as real art and when the Model trains on this Dataset it miss classifies some of the images and also if it classifies correctly but still the confidence is very low
